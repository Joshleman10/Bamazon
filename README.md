This is a node based app in combination with the use of a MYSQL database to provie an online shopping experience.  The item names, 
inventory quantities, item ID's, department, and prices are all stored in a MYSQL database.  Using the node package inquirer, the 
customer works their way through prompts to place an order, selecting an item, and a quantity of that item they would like to purchase.
After placing the order, both the remaining inventory as well as the price are given to the customer.  If the customer orders more than
the total stock quantity, they are asked to try again with an order quantity lower than the total in stock.
